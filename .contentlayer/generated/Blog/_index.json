But when I saw that my PageSpeed rating was suffering because of it, I was at a loss. I scoured the internet looking for a simple, yet effective way to lazy-load Google Analytics, but all I found were overly complicated solutions that had me scratching my head. After wrestling with the problem for what felt like an eternity, I finally figured out the perfect way to lazy-load Google Analytics.\n\n<br />\n\n> ## First, what is Lazy-loading?\n\nLazy-loading is a way of making your website faster by only loading certain pieces of content when they are needed. It’s a great way to reduce the amount of time your site takes to load, and can be especially useful when it comes to loading Google Analytics. By lazy-loading Google Analytics, you can ensure that your tracking code is only loaded when a visitor interacts with your website. This can help you improve your website’s performance, and make your visitors’ experience that much smoother.\n\n<br />\n\n> ## How It Works\n\nThe way we will lazy-load Google Analytics is by waiting for the user to scroll down the page before loading the Google Analytics tracking code. This means that visitors who simply load the page and don’t scroll won’t trigger the Google Analytics tracking code. You’ll need to decide whether or not you’re okay with this trade-off for the performance boost. For my use case, I wasn’t too concerned about tracking those visitors who simply loaded the page and immediately bounced. I only wanted to get data from those who were truly interacting with my website, so this trade-off worked for me.\n",
