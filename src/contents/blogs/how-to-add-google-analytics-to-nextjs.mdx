## Introduction

Google Analytics serves as a web analytics service delivering statistics and fundamental analytical tools essential for search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing strategies. Integrating to your Next.js application allows you track website performance and collect visitor insights, gauge the success of their marketing activities and campaigns, discover patterns and trends in user engagement. Today we will see how to integrate Google Analytics into a Next.js application.

### Step 1 - Setting up Google Analytics

- To get started, let's visit the [Analytics dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web) and create you new account. If you register for the first time, you will be asked to add a new property.
- After completing the setup, you will be taken to a new platform page for your account.

### Step 2 - Initialize the project

If you just want integrate to your project, you can skip this step.

- Create a new NextJS applicate by running the following command:

```jsx
npx create-next-app@latest your-next-app
```

### Step 3 - Add to environment

Add your Google Analytics id to **\`.env\`**.

```jsx title=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS = 'your_google_analytics_id';
```

### Step 4 - Add Google Analytics

Add script load Google Tag Manager into \_app.js

```jsx title="_app.js"
import { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import Head from 'next/head';
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import './styles.css';
import Script from 'next/script';
import Router from 'next/router';

const GTM_ID = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS;

function App({ Component, pageProps, router }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        id='google-tag-manager'
        strategy='afterInteractive'
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: `(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
                  new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
                  j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
                  'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
                  })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','${GTM_ID}');
          `,
        }}
      />

      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Step 5 - Check if the Google Analytics is enabled

Run you application by following command

```js
yarn dev
// or yarn build & yarn start
```

And go to the URL **[http://localhost:3000]** and open the console.

If you see **undefined** then there was something wrong. If you see something like the above picture, then analytics is activated.
