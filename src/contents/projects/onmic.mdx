> ## Short Explanation

As the first audio application developed by Vietnamese people, OnMic provides the ability to create live chat rooms (voice-streaming), with interaction between speakers and listeners. Instead of using text, photos, or videos as a means of communication, OnMic allows people to "gather" in audio chat rooms to listen and talk about a variety of topics. Here, users can build relationships with friends and colleagues quickly with just a smartphone without spending any money.

> ## Lessons Learned

This is the first project that i had worked in a product company. I experienced the process of making a technology product, then maintaining and fixing bugs.

We are keep track of everything in Trello and assign the task on that app. It is
really fun working with a lot of people and try bunch of new ideas and communicate
our differences. I also learned a lot about developing a website with a bunch of
floating illustrations and absolutely-positioned elements. I usually avoid making
designs with illustrations that are absolutely-positioned
